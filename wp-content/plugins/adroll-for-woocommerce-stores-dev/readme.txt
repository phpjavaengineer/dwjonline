Connect your WooCommerce store to AdRoll and start serving retargeted ads across the web and Facebook.

== Description ==

**Plugin Features**

* The plugin places the AdRoll pixel - no need to place any code on your site.

* We automatically create a cart segment and a checkout segment, so you can set up a cart abandonment campaign in a flash.

* Track the number of sales and amount of revenue driven by the AdRoll campaign using an automatically-created conversion segment that passes back exact conversion values

**AdRoll Features**

* Access to all of the major display networks and Facebook

* Design Squad: we’ll make ads for you!

* A delightful support team: we’ll provide technical support and advice on how to set up an effective campaign

* SendRoll: send dynamic product emails triggered by customer behavior on your site.

* Integrations with other platforms

 * Easily connect your MailChimp or Campaign Monitor account to retarget your email lists with ads

 * Use Zapier to zap customer emails into retargeting segments

 * Use AdRoll’s pixel as a container and flip on integrations with Optimizely, Customer.io, Heap, and more, without placing additional code
